	<h2>The LDAP Class for PHP</h2>
	<b>Installation</b><br>
	<br>
	Since it is just a single include file, all you need to do is put the
	ldap.inc file in your PHP include directory.  You can put it anywhere you want, as
	long as it can be included from your PHP script.
	<p>
	<b>Configuration</b><br>
	<br>
	Configuration is almost as easy as the Installation.  You need to modify
	the FIVE defines at the top of the ldap.inc file.  These defines set
	the default hostname, basedn, binddn, bindpw, and the path to the
	slapd.oc.conf file.  If you don't change these values.. it probably won't
	work right.
