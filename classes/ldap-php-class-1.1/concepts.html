	<h2>The LDAP Class for PHP</h2>
	The idea behind this class, is that you can navigate through your
	LDAP directory server using the same methods you would use to navigate
	a UNIX filesystem.
	<p>
	This works pretty will for navigation, but adding and retrieving data
	are somewhat different.  I used a pretty standard method of retrieving
	data, similar to most methods of database access.  (ie. search, then fetch).
	For adding data, it's much different than you may expect.  There is no
	add() function in the class.  There really isn't a need for one.  When you
	make a directory (LDAP translation: add an entry) into your directory
	server, to add attributes, you would just need to modify the existing
	entry.
	<p>
	If you're new to LDAP, this probably won't be too hard for you.  If you've
	already been exposed to LDAP, it may take some getting used to.
	<p>
	Think of all of your entries as directories.  Each directory can have files
	(attributes), and subdirectories (entries) in them.  When you think about it
	this way, you can rm() attributes, and rmdir() entries.  This is the
	basis for this class.
